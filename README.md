Sentiment is very important now a days as we are living a digital era.

Here i have sentimint analysis or classification problem, we can call it using different vectorizations and different algorithms.

1. Bag of Words
    In NLP, BoW represents text documents as a collection of unique words, disregarding their order or grammar. Each word becomes a feature, creating a sparse vector where the frequencies of these features represent the document. Imagine a "bag" containing individual words from a document, not caring about their arrangement.
  
  Why use BoW?
  
  Simplicity: BoW is easy to implement and understand.
  
  Efficiency: It handles large datasets efficiently by reducing text to numerical features.
  
  Effectiveness: BoW can be effective for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and document classification.
  
  Limitations of BoW:
  
  Loss of semantics: BoW ignores word order and context, potentially missing key information.
  
  High dimensionality: Large vocabularies can lead to sparse and high-dimensional feature vectors.

2. Ngrams
   
   N-grams are a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP) used to model sequences of words or units in text data. Think of them as contiguous chunks of characters, words, or even syllables extracted from a text. Let's delve deeper into their purpose and applications:

  What are N-grams?

  The "N" in n-grams refers to the number of units in the sequence.
  
  For example, unigrams represent single words, bigrams are word pairs, trigrams are word triplets, and so on.
  
  They capture the inherent patterns and relationships between words, which are crucial for many NLP tasks.
  
  Why are N-grams useful?
  
  Language Modeling: N-grams help predict the next word in a sequence, enabling tasks like autocompletion and text generation.
  
  Sentiment Analysis: Understanding the sentiment of text often depends on the sequences of words used. N-grams can capture positive, negative, or neutral word co-occurrences.
  
  Machine Translation: Analyzing word sequences in source and target languages improves the quality of machine translation.
  
  Topic Modeling: Identifies groups of related words (topics) by analyzing frequently occurring n-grams within documents.
  
  Types of N-grams:
  
  Unigrams: Individual words are the simplest form.
  
  Bigrams: Two consecutive words capture basic word pairings, like "natural language".

  Trigrams: Sequences of three words capture more complex relationships, like "machine learning model".
  
  Higher-order n-grams: Can be used, but the usefulness drops as the sequence length increases due to sparsity (fewer occurrences). 

3. TFIDF
     
  TF-IDF, which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, is a popular technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to quantify the importance of a word to a document in a collection. It considers both how often a word appears within a document (its term frequency) and how rare it is across the entire collection of documents (its inverse document frequency).
  
  Here's a breakdown of its key elements:
  
  Term Frequency (TF):
  
  Measures how often a word appears in a specific document.
  
  A higher TF indicates the word is more "important" to that document.
  
  Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):
  
  Measures how rare a word is across the entire document collection.
  
  A lower IDF indicates the word is more common and thus less "distinctive."
  
  Combined TF-IDF:
  
  Multiplies the TF and IDF values for each word in a document.
  
  Words that appear frequently within a document but rarely across the collection will have high TF-IDF scores, signifying their importance in capturing the unique content of that document.
  
  Applications of TF-IDF:
  
  Information retrieval: Ranking documents relevant to a search query based on the TF-IDF scores of relevant keywords.
  
  Document clustering: Grouping documents with similar themes based on their shared keywords and TF-IDF scores.
  
  Text summarization: Identifying and extracting key sentences based on their TF-IDF scores.
  
  Topic modeling: Discovering latent topics in a document collection by analyzing word distributions and TF-IDF scores.
  
  Advantages of TF-IDF:
  
  Simple and efficient to calculate.
  
  Effective in weighting keywords based on their importance.
  
  Can be used with various NLP tasks and algorithms.
  
  Limitations of TF-IDF:
  
  Ignores word order and context, potentially missing important semantic information.
  
  Sensitive to stop words and common phrases, requiring pre-processing steps.
  
  Less effective for very short documents or highly specialized vocabulary.

4. Word2Vec
   Word2Vec, short for "Word to Vector," is a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP) used to represent words as numerical vectors. These vectors capture the semantic relationships between words, enabling various NLP tasks. Here's a breakdown:
  
  How it works:
  
  Word Embedding: Word2Vec processes a large corpus of text, analyzing how words co-occur with each other in different contexts.
  
  Neural Network Training: It utilizes a neural network architecture to learn a mapping between words and vectors.
  
  Vector Representation: Each word is assigned a unique vector in a multidimensional space, where similar words have similar vector representations.
  
  Benefits of Word2Vec:
  
  Captures Semantics: The vectors encapsulate semantic relationships between words, reflecting their meaning and usage.
  
  Predictive Power: You can use these vectors for tasks like predicting missing words, generating similar sentences, and performing other word analogies.
  
  Wide Applications: Word2Vec is used in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, text summarization, and more.
  
  Different Word2Vec Models:
  
  Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW): Predicts a target word based on its surrounding context words.
  
  Skip-gram: Predicts surrounding context words based on a given target word.
  
  Limitations to Consider:
  
  Large corpus dependency: Requires a large dataset for effective training.
  
  High dimensionality: The resulting vectors can be high-dimensional, requiring dimensionality reduction techniques for specific tasks.
  
  Contextual limitations: While capturing semantics, it may not handle complex nuances like sarcasm or irony.
